Although it's not always possible, it can be incredibly satisfying to just
load part of your program into node and poke at it interactively. The node
REPL (read-eval-print loop) is pretty bare-bones, though, and so it's worth
looking at one of the many more elaborate modules that build on the REPL.
replpad adds a ton of features, including reloading your source files when
they're changed.
